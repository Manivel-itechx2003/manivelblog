                <h2>The Origins of Kabaddi</h2>
                <p>Kabaddi traces its origins back over 4,000 years to ancient India. It is believed to have been a way for villagers to stay fit and practice self-defense. Over the centuries, Kabaddi evolved, spreading across different regions of India, each with its variations of the game. The basic premise, however, remained the same: a team-based sport that demands agility, strength, and quick thinking.</p>

                <h2>The Rules of the Game</h2>
                <p>Kabaddi is a game of two teams, each consisting of seven players. The objective is simple yet challenging: a player from one team, known as the "raider," enters the opposing team's half of the court, attempts to tag as many defenders as possible, and then returns to their side without being caught—all while holding their breath and chanting "Kabaddi, Kabaddi." The defenders, on the other hand, work together to catch the raider and prevent them from returning to their side.</p>

                <h2>Kabaddi's Global Rise</h2>
                <p>While Kabaddi has always been popular in India, it has recently gained international attention, thanks in part to the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) launched in 2014. The league has brought a modern twist to the traditional game, with professional teams, star players, and a global fanbase. The fast-paced, high-energy nature of Kabaddi has made it a hit, drawing in spectators from around the world.</p>
